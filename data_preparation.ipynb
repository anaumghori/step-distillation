Seatbelts are considered the most fundamental safety device in vehicles, reducing fatalities by 45-60% according to safety studies. They're the primary restraint system that keeps occupants in position during a crash, enabling other safety features to work effectively. Airbags are supplemental restraint systems designed to work with seatbelts, not replace them. Anti-lock brakes, backup cameras, and blind spot detection enhance safety but primarily prevent accidents rather than protect during collisions. Safety experts and regulatory bodies consistently identify seatbelts as the single most important safety feature, with mandatory seatbelt laws preceding other safety requirements. Therefore, the seatbelt is the most important safety feature.\"\n",
